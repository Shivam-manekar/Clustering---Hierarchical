# Clustering---Hierarchical
Hierarchical clustering is a method of unsupervised machine learning that is used to group similar items together based on their distance or similarity. In the context of wholesale customer data, hierarchical clustering can be used to group similar customers together based on their purchasing behavior.
The process of hierarchical clustering involves repeatedly grouping the closest two items or clusters together into larger clusters until all items or clusters are part of a single, large cluster. This results in a dendrogram, which is a tree-like structure that shows the hierarchy of clusters.
To apply hierarchical clustering to wholesale customer data, the first step is to choose a distance metric to measure the similarity between customers. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and cosine similarity. Once the distance metric is chosen, the data is organized into a distance matrix.
Next, the hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied to the distance matrix, starting with each customer as its own cluster. The algorithm then iteratively merges the closest clusters together until all customers are part of a single, large cluster. The resulting dendrogram can be cut at a certain height to produce a desired number of clusters.
